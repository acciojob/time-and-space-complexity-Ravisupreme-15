    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

	 <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete its task. It's efficient to design algorithms that are not only correct but also efficient in terms of time complexity.</p>
  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a measure of how much memory an algorithm uses to perform its task. In computer science, we often analyze the space complexity in terms of the input size <em>n</em>. An algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the amount of memory it uses is proportional to the size of the input.</p>
